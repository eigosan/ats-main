                            is
                            designed for the Public Employment Service Office (PESO) in Tarlac City to streamline and
                            enhance their recruitment process. This system leverages advanced machine learning
                            techniques,
                            including the KNN algorithm, to efficiently classify and rank job applicants based on
                            various
                            criteria such as qualifications, skills, and job relevance. NLP is integrated to analyze and
                            process unstructured data from resumes and cover letters, extracting key information and
                            matching candidates with suitable job listings. The goal of this ATS is to provide PESO with
                            an
                            intelligent, automated tool that simplifies applicant screening, improves job matching
                            accuracy,
                            and accelerates the employment process for both job seekers and employers in the local
